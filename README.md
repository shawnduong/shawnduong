### Howdy!

I'm not really that active on GitHub. Actually, I'm not really that active anywhere on the public-facing internet except for on my [blog](https://shawnd.xyz/blog/), where I post weekly updates. If you're looking to contact me, please send a message to the email listed on my GitHub profile.

I'm also the head admin and a hacker at IrisSec, an international crew of some of the most amazing hackers I've had the blessing of meeting! I specifically specialize in network security and digital forensics, although I'm happy to be branching into binary exploitation, reverse engineering, and web application security thanks to some of my awesome teammates and their infinite patience. All inquiries related to IrisSec should be sent to our email listed on our [website](https://irissec.xyz/contact). I do **not** respond to inquiries related to IrisSec on GitHub nor on my primary contact email.
